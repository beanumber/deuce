\usage{
in_match_win(
  point_a,
  point_b,
  game_a,
  game_b,
  set_a,
  set_b,
  server.prob,

  bestof3 = TRUE,
  advantage = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{point_a}{Numeric game points won by current server at start of point}

\item{point_b}{Numeric game points won by current returner at start of point}

\item{game_a}{Numeric games won by current server in the current set}

\item{game_b}{Numeric games won by current returner in the current set}

\item{set_a}{Numeric sets won by current server}

\item{set_b}{Numeric sets won by current returner}

\item{server.prob}{Numeric serve win prob of current server}

\item{returner.prob}{Numeric serve win prob of current returner}

\item{bestof3}{Logical indicator if best-of-3 match (TRUE) or best-of-5 (FALSE)}

\item{advantage}{Logical if advantage set match (TRUE) or tiebreak match (FALSE)}
}
\value{
Numeric probability that current server will win the match
}
\description{
This function calculates the conditional match win prediction for matches in progress conditioned on the current score
